# Task-2-Student-Record-Manage-System
This project is a console-based Java application developed to manage student information efficiently using basic programming concepts such as classes, objects, loops, switch-case, ArrayList, and user input handling. The application is entirely text-based and runs in the command line, allowing the user to interact with a menu-driven interface.
